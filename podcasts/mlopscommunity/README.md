- **Talk title:** "Guarding LLM and NLP APIs: A Trailblazing Odyssey for Enhanced Security"
  - Posted Nov 13, 2023
- **Abstract:**
   - _[Ads Dawson](https://linkedin.com/in/adamdawson0), a seasoned security engineer at Cohere, explores the challenges and solutions in securing large language models (LLMs) and natural language programming APIs. Drawing on his extensive experience, Ads discusses approaches to threat modeling LLM applications, preventing data breaches, defending against attacks, and bolstering the security of these critical technologies. The presentation also delves into the success of the "OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications" project, co-founded by Ads, which identifies key vulnerabilities in the industry. Notably, Ads owns three of the top 10 vulnerabilities, including Training Data Poisoning, Sensitive Information Disclosure, and Model Theft._
   - _This OWASP Top 10 serves as a foundational resource for stakeholders in AI, offering guidance on using, developing, and securing LLM applications. Additionally, the session covers insider news from the AI Village's 'Hack the Future' | LLM Red Teaming event at Defcon31, providing insights into the inaugural Generative AI Red Teaming showdown and its significance in addressing security and privacy concerns amid the widespread adoption of AI._

- **Talk title:** "AI in Production"
  - Posted Nov 13, 2023
- **Abstract:**
   _- Large Language Models have taken the world by storm. But what are the real use cases? What are the challenges in productionizing them? In this event, you will hear from practitioners about how they are dealing with things such as cost optimization, latency requirements, trust of output and debugging. You will also get the opportunity to join workshops that will teach you how to set up your use cases and skip over all the headaches._
