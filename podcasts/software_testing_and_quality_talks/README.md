- **Abstract:**

Several people in the software testing community expressed interest in learning about red teaming for cyber security. Some asked for red teaming course and also for the red teaming roadmap. So I decided to talk to Adam Dawson who works as the application security red team engineer. We discuss about red teaming with Adam, specifically in the context of GenAI and LLMs.
Ads Dawson is a dynamic force with over 13 years of expertise in security engineering, offensive security, and red team operations, boasting over thirteen years of dynamic, full-stack hands-on experience. From networking to application security and forking into MLSecOps, Ads has mastered a diverse range of domains, making waves in classic penetration testing. A self-motivated, inquisitive, and adept security red teamer, bug bounty researcher, and cybersecurity professional, Ads has led the OWASP LLM Application security project core working group and is also now part of the MITRE AI Working Group, pushing the boundaries of AI security and MLSecOps. Ads uncovers new tactics, techniques, and threat vectors in an ever-evolving landscape. He excels in adversarial red teaming activities, leveraging machine learning concepts to refine his skills, and is particularly adept at breaking technology through creative automation techniques.
Join us as Ads Dawson, Technical Release Lead & Entry Lead at OWASP for Large Language Model Applications, and a veteran security engineer at Cohere, guides us through the intricate landscape of safeguarding large language models and natural language programming APIs. Delve into the complexities of defending against data breaches and cyber threats while strengthening the security posture of these vital technologies. Gain invaluable insights and actionable strategies from Ads's wealth of expertise and discover how tools such as OWASP Top 10 for LLMs play a pivotal role in mitigating risks. Don't pass up the chance to learn from a distinguished industry authority!
