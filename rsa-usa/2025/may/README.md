üö® The Future of AI Security Is Now ‚Äî Final Agenda Announced for the OWASP AI Security Summit @ RSAC 2025 üö®

Join us on April 30th from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM PT at Moscone South, Room 308, during RSA Conference 2025 in San Francisco for one of the most timely and critical summits of the year. Open to all RSA Conference pass holder levels. 

üéØ Theme: Safeguarding GenAI & Agentic Apps: Top 10 LLM and Generative AI Risks in 2025

As the age of agentic AI rapidly arrives, where autonomous systems can plan, act, and learn, the security community must rise to meet new and emerging challenges.

At the OWASP AI Security Summit, we‚Äôre bringing together top experts, builders, and defenders to share insights, tools, and real-world lessons to help organizations secure this next generation of intelligent systems.

Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs On The Agenda:

‚úÖ Top 10 LLM Security Risks for 2025
 A dive into OWASP‚Äôs evolving list of the top risks facing large language models and GenAI, including upcoming updates in the 2.0 release and what organizations can do today to mitigate these threats.

‚úÖ SecOps for GenAI & the Evolving Security Landscape
 What‚Äôs changing in the AI security operations playbook? Learn about the emerging OWASP AI solution landscape and how security teams are adapting to AI-native architectures.

‚úÖ OWASP Red Team COMPASS v1.0
 Introducing a powerful new methodology for assessing AI/ML risks using red teaming, threat intelligence, and organizational context, enabling cybersecurity leaders to map and measure their AI attack surface.

‚úÖ From Risk to Resilience: Securing Agentic Frontiers
 A must-see panel exploring the realities vs. hype of securing agentic AI. Should companies build their agents or use off-the-shelf copilots? How do we scale AI while maintaining oversight and compliance? Join our expert panel for the conversation.

‚úÖ Red Teaming Agentic & Non-Agentic AI
Join our expert panel to discover best practices and ethical considerations from OWASP‚Äôs new Generative AI Red Teaming Guide, focused on adversarial testing, boundary analysis, and aligning AI behavior with human values.

Whether you're building autonomous AI agents, securing LLM applications, or trying to understand the practical risks of today‚Äôs GenAI deployments, this summit is your front-row seat to the future of AI security.
