Using their AIRTBench benchmark of 70 AI/ML security challenges and their Strikes evaluation platform, Ads demonstrates that these aren't just pattern-matching machines but genuine problem-solvers adapting under pressure, marking a pivotal moment where AI offensive capabilities have officially surpassed most human expertsâ€”and they're sharing the complete dataset so the security community can prepare for what's coming next.",
