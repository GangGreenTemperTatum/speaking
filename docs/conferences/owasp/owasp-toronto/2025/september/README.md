Presentation Title: Becoming a Caido Power User: From Recon to Root
Dive into Caido (caido.io)—a sleek, open web-security toolkit built with efficiency and clarity in mind. Forget clunky tools: Caido offers a clean, intuitive IDE-style interface with powerful features like HTTP proxy, request replay, automations, sitemap visualization, HTTPQL filtering, and easy project management

In this hands-on session:

Walk through real-world usage—intercept traffic, replay requests, automate payloads, and map out vulnerable apps.
Explore pro tips—use HTTPQL for fast filtering, build workflows and plugins with just HTML/JS, and manage multiple projects effortlessly.
Live demo—watch me break a sample vulnerable application using Caido’s workflow engine, match-and-replace rules, and findings interface.
Q&A jam—get answers on optimizing Caido for your bug bounty hunts or pentest engagements.
Whether you're starting fresh or looking for a faster, more efficient replacement for tools like Burp Suite, this session will equip you with everything you need to go from zero to Caido hero. Hack smart, stay organized, and own your AppSec game.

We encourage anyone to bring their laptops!
