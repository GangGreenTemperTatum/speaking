- **Talk title:** "Behind the Prompt: Exposing and Mitigating the Top LLM Vulnerabilities"
  - July 8, 2025 (Tuesday), @ 12:05 p.m. - 1:05 p.m. (LIVE)
  - **Abstract:**

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into enterprise products, critical infrastructure and autonomous systems, attackers are racing to uncover ‚Äì and exploit ‚Äì their weak spots. From prompt injection and data leakage to model manipulation and autonomous misuse, these vulnerabilities aren‚Äôt hypothetical ‚Äì they‚Äôre already in the wild.

In this session, both the Technical Lead and the Program Manager of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications will walk attendees through the most impactful and emerging threats to LLM-integrated systems. Drawing from real-world red teaming operations, adversarial evaluations and industry-wide collaboration through OWASP, they‚Äôll break down:

What the top LLM-specific vulnerabilities are right now
Why these weaknesses are so exploitable, often in ways traditional application security doesn't cover
How to start building practical mitigation strategies today
This talk is designed for builders, breakers and security leaders who want to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving LLM threat landscape ‚Äì without the hype. You‚Äôll leave with a grounded understanding of how to think offensively about LLMs and defensively about their deployment.

Speakers:
Ads Dawson: Technical Lead, OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications
Steve Wilson: Founder and Co-chair, OWASP Gen AI Security Project
